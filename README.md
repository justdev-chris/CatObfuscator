# CatObfuscator üêæ

CatObfuscator is a simple HTML obfuscator built entirely in HTML + JavaScript.  
It encodes your HTML (including any inline CSS or JS) into a form that's hard to read, while still being fully functional when loaded in a browser.  

---

## Features

- Obfuscates HTML code directly in the browser.  
- Works with inline CSS and JS.  
- No Node.js or backend required ‚Äî 100% client-side.  
- Lightweight and fast.  
- Dark/neutral style for a cool, "techy" vibe.  

---

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Paste your HTML code into the **Input** box.  
3. Click the **Obfuscate** button.  
4. Copy the obfuscated code from the **Output** box.  
5. Save it as a `.html` file to use anywhere.

## Notes

- Only obfuscates code in the HTML file itself. External JS or CSS files are not automatically obfuscated.  
- The obfuscation is mainly for readability protection, not security.
